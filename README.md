# ðŸ“° News Overlay Widget

A playful little news overlay for fans of news in **PT-BR** and **EN**!  
Just run it and scroll through a wild mix of Brazilian and international headlines right on your desktop.  
Super minimal, no ads, no nonsense, just the news and a big arrow. Because news should be fun (or at least mildly distracting)!

## Features

- Fetches headlines from major PT-BR and EN sources (G1, NYTimes, BBC, etc).
- Pretty overlay window, draggable and resizable.
- Clickable links to read more.
- Friendly for both English and Portuguese readers.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- See `requirements.txt`

## Usage

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Press `â†“` or click the arrow for more news.  
Drag to move, ESC to quit!

For serious news... maybe just open a browser.  
But for quick inspiration (or procrastination), this is your widget! ðŸ˜„
